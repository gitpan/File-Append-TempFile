File-Append-TempFile version 0.05
=================================


The File::Append::TempFile module provides an OOP interface to appending
data to files using a temporary file, in order to ensure the atomicity of
the updates.  Care should be taken to ensure that no other applications
try to modify the original file concurrently, since any changes made while
appending the data may be lost.

The most recent version of the module should always be available via CPAN,
and also, along with an unofficial Debian package, at the Ringlet
development webserver -
http://devel.ringlet.net/sysutils/file-append-tempfile/

DEPENDENCIES
